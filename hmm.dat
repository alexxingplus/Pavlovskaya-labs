You can control the Chroma lights battery consumption with the included app. There are three power modes: low (notifications only), medium (works only when the screen is on), and high (always on). I used the high power mode during most of my time with the Razer Phone 2, and I found that it didnt dramatically drain the battery. So your decision about what to do with that light-up logo comes down to how much you like light-up logos.I was really disappointed when I found out that I couldnt use the Chroma app to control other Chroma-equipped devices I have at home. There is no Synapse 3 app equivalent for the Razer Phone 2. Hopefully, that will change in the future because a phone would be the ideal control hub for all of my Chroma gear. THE CHROMA LOGO IS A NICE TOUCH. Also, Razer representatives told me that the rear panel on an upcoming variant (with more storage) will receive a matte finish but still retain wireless charging. If you really want to avoid a slippery glass back, you should look forward to it. The volume buttons and power / fingerprint button are in the middle on the left and right sides of the phone, respectively. They take some getting used to, but they pay off when youre playing games in landscape mode since they’re not too close to your fingers. Also, an improvement made to the fingerprint button this year makes it more accurate on your first try. It’s much better this time around, and I’ve had no issues with it.So those are the basics of the hardware, but the whole reason this phone exists is to be a platform for gaming. One of the first things that makes the Razer Phone 2 a “gaming phone” is its 5.7-inch 120Hz QHD screen that’s bolstered by a wide color gamut for viewing HDR content. The high refresh rate echoes PC gaming in some ways because it allows you to see more frames a second — just on a phone, not a high-end monitor. It all seems like a gimmick, but it pays off.
